The answer - most likely to a landfill or an incinerator.

It is estimated that this amount of e-waste could fill up a football field six times over. This will only increase as the need for electronics continues to grow, which means more e-waste will be generated as well.";

According to Kwaku Afriyie, Ghana's Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), the work launched in October 2018 is 65% complete. The plant built by Memphis Metropolitan is funded to the tune of €10 million (over 84 million Ghanaian cedis) with support from the German government.

The centre “aims to reduce the environmental impact of e-waste recycling activities in the country, ensure the transition of e-waste through proper and sound procedures, test a pricing or financing mechanism,” says Minister Kwaku Afriyie. The centre is a result of the Electronic and Hazardous Waste Control and Management Act passed in 2016 in Ghana. The initiative also aims to create at least 22,000 jobs for Ghana’s youth.";

Today, 99.9% of electrical and electronic waste equipment (e-waste) is currently unmanaged or mismanaged. The A transition toward a circular economy approach will have positive impacts on both the reduction of 33 per cent electronic and electrical equipment placed on the market, 14 per cent less e-waste generation and an estimated total of 130 t of gold, 5 t of rare earth metals, 17 Mt of iron and steel, and many other materials could be recycled to 2050. Simultaneously, a larger proportion of hazardous materials and greenhouse gases will be managed in an environmentally sound manner, leading to mitigated emissions of up to 6 t of mercury, 60 t of cadmium, and 53 Mt CO2 equivalent.
